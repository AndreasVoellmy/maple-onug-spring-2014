======================

This repository contains the proof-of-concept WAN optimizer application developed at the Spring 2014 ONUG Hackathon. 


Architecture
============

Here we describe the setup of branch sites/data center, MPLS routers and WAN links, etc.


Network Simulation
==================

Here we describe how we use mininet to emulate the environment, including instructions on how to start mininet, configure the MPLS routers, etc. 


Controllers
===========

Here we describe the overall organization of the controllers, how to start them, where to find the source code, how to get to the GUI (web page).


Demo

Here we describe how to run through the demo that we showed at the hackathon. Describe how to set up the traffic flows, what buttons to push and what should happen in each state.
